# Set this to true if you want to run on HTTP in case of HTTPS misconfiguration; when 'false' and on HTTPS a redirect HTTP -> HTTPS is setup.
# Please be aware that, as the name suggests, this introduces a safety concern. Be aware that if "unsafe" mode is on then, in case of SSL setup
# failures, HTTP is tried automatically.
# For the server, this means that if we cannot start on SSL then we just try to start on HTTP; and intercom will be HTTP only too.
# For the client/ui, same as the server for the webapp listener and backend connection too. Please also be aware that on pure HTTP no data is ever
# encrypted!
# Unsafe mode is meant for debug as well as a way to fallback on faulty HTTPS.

# Security implications, see above.
